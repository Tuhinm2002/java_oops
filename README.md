## 🔄 Inheritance

Inheritance allows a new class to inherit properties and behavior from an existing class.

### 🏗️ Multi-Level Inheritance

Multi-Level Inheritance involves a class derived from another class, which is also derived from another class.

### 🧩 Singleton Inheritance

Singleton Inheritance refers to a class inheriting properties from a single parent class.

### 🔀 Interfaces for Multiple Inheritance

Java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance directly, but it can be achieved using **Interfaces**. A class can implement multiple interfaces to inherit behavior from various sources.

## 🔒 Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit. It involves hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.

## 🌟 Abstraction

Abstraction involves hiding the implementation details and exposing only the essential features. Getters and setters are often used to access or modify private variables.

## 🎭 Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The **@Override** annotation is used to modify the behavior of an inherited method.

## 📜 Interfaces

Interfaces in Java enable multiple inheritance. A class can implement multiple interfaces, inheriting methods from multiple sources.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
